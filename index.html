You don't want to hurt me, But see how deep the bullet lies. Unaware I'm tearing you asunder - There is thunder in our hearts. Is there so much hate for the ones we love? We both matter, don't we?

<p>The therapist sat across from Deming, a clipboard laying on her lap. <b>"I'd like to discuss something in more detail that you brought up last session. You said you felt as though you were addicted to sex. I'd like to get a sense of what you meant by this."</b></p>

<p>Deming shifted in his seat and nervously adjusted his tie. <b>"I meant it plainly. I'm addicted to sex. I'm addicting to fucking and being fucked."</b> He felt his face visibly redden at the phrasing. <i>I'm addicted to fucking and being fucked.</i> It was the truth, laid out bare.</p>

<p><b>"I'm curious to know, do you think there is a reason for this?"</b></p>

<p>It was a simple question, with a simple answer. One Deming had realized for himself a long, long time ago. <b>"The first time I ever felt truly loved by another person, it was when..."</b> when, the first time he had another man inside of him. The first time he had ever felt the hands of another on him, in him. <b>"My parents are two of the least loving people I have ever met. They are both singular-minded: money, business, contracts. Transactional - they're transactional people. There was never any love between them - they're pragmatists. They saw in each other a counterpart that loved capitalism and upward mobility just as much as the other did. I don't even think they wanted a child, I think...no, I was certainly a calculated decision on their part too. Being a "family man" helps heterosexual men in business. It makes them seem more approachable, or so I've heard. It tends to do the opposite for heterosexual businesswomen, I believe. But that never stopped my mother. I think she likes being an antagonist."</b> He paused and adjusted his tie again. <b>"I'd be lying if I said I thought either of them loved me. Maybe they do, in a vague 'this is my offspring' sort of way. But they never made me <i>feel</i> loved. I don't think either of them have said those words to me, not once in my life."</b>

<p>The therapist jotted down a couple of notes on her clipboard, and Deming tried to not think about what she was writing about him. <b>"What do you think about your relationship with the two of them now?"</b></p>

<p>Deming laughed a bitter, joyless laugh. <b>"What relationship? I hardly had one with them when I was a kid. Once I was a teenager, I barely saw them, they worked so much. And now? I see them once, twice a year maybe. For the holidays, and occasionally my mother comes to Seoul for work and makes me get dinner with her. We're essentially strangers."</b></P>

<p>She took a few more notes, and Deming fiddled with his sleeve, then realized the nervous habit, and put his hands in his lap. <b>"How about  you tell me something different. I'm curious to know about  your first sexual experience. How old were you? What was the person like?"</b></p>

<p>A soft, warm smile appeared on Deming's face. <b>"I was seventeen, in my last year of high school..."</b></p>

<hr>

<p>He was on his way to school, standing squished up next to a handful of people on the train. He was late, which wasn't shocking - both of his parents had already left for work long before he woke up, and the night prior he had stayed up quite late working on a new untitled remix crossing a Sonic the Hedgehog song with some old 80s American song. As he stood on the train, listening to some sad Kate Bush music, he found himself gazing aimlessly at a bear of a man in front of him. He was tall, probably around 6 feet at least, give or take, with jet black hair and a thick, curly beard that framed his bronzed face. The pants he wore were exceptionally tight, and he had a large thumb stuck into the waist of those tight black jeans. His hands were huge, and Deming found the amount of hair on his knuckles to be quite alluring - surprising, he had never thought of hairy guys as attractive but this man certainly was. The way his thick hand framed his...god his dick must be huge. He could see the line of it through the man's tight pants, it was tucked down the side of one leg. His hand moved, just a bit, and his large fingers rested right against the side of his very large but (presumably) flaccid dick. Deming felt his face visibly heat up, but he couldn't tear his eyes away. </p>

<p>Deming wasn't totally sure when he had realized that he was exclusively attracted to men. There were memories that were obvious - in swim class at eleven, when he was in the locker room he saw two boys wrestling each other and laughing while they were both butt-naked. When he put his glasses on and looked over to them, he felt his face heat up immediately. He looked away as quickly as he could, and determinedly started at the floor until he felt his face cool off. Then there was the time when he was fourteen - he had slept over at a friend's house and woke up in the middle of the night and heard soft, heavy breathing coming from his friend's bed. He couldn't see anything, but he could hear it all - the breathing, the sound of a lotioned hand against hard skin, and then the quiet, breathless moan as his friend came. He willed his eyes closed, willed his body to not move, and then when he heard the soft snoring of his friend, he licked his hand and gave himself an embarrassed, ashamed release. He never slept over at this friend's house again - how could he? He was terrified of the thought of waking up again, hearing his friend's quiet moaning, the sound of him touching himself. Since that time, he would come up with vague, half-assed excuses for being busy, or grounded (an obvious lie to his friend, who knew his parents were never home and didn't much care about what Deming did with his free time). Eventually they drifted apart, or Deming pushed them apart, terrified of what would happen again, if there was a repeat of that night. In retrospect, maybe it would have been healthy for both of them - a bit of adolescent exploration with another teenager. Maybe if he had allowed himself to enjoy the company of his friend, he wouldn't have such <i>maladaptive coping mechanisms</i>.</p>

<p>Eventually, the man's stop must have came, because he pushed through the crowds, and Deming went from staring at the man's full pants, to staring at his own shoes. He let out a little sigh. What would it feel like, to have a dick like that? To touch it? Before he had time to let himself go down that train of thought, he felt a large hand against his ass, a squeeze that made him jump, and then a pat. Deming looked around, and saw the older man looking over his shoulder as he got off the train, and gave him a wink. Deming felt as though he were steaming, he was so hot. Nobody had ever done <i>anything</i> like that to him - certainly, nobody had ever touched him there, on his butt.</p>

<p>Later that day at school, when Deming changed for PE class he noticed a business card folded up in his pants pocket. His face immediately started steaming again. The card was in English - easily his worst subject - but after some staring he was able to parse the words out "Rodrigo Esteban Garcia Zapadero, PhD Candidiate, Anthropology, University of California, San Diego". and under the text, was passable hangul that he <i>could</i> read that said "Call me sometime : )" and a phone number.</p>

<p>Deming was MIA for the rest of the school day, and as soon as he finally was released from his last class, he fastwalked his way away from campus, turning down a few random streets before he felt comfortable enough to call him. He had practiced saying his name over and over in his head during school, and still didn't feel confident about calling him. But he did it anyways, typing the number and double-checking it before he put his flip phone to his ears. It rang a couple times, and then he answered: <b>"Hello?"</b> in English.</p>

<p>Deming's English was good enough that he could have a basic conversation, though the idea of speaking to a guy on the phone who had grabbed his ass earlier in the day, in English, was a bit terrifying. <b>"Umm, ummmmm, hello, you um, you - this morning-"</b></p>

<p>Blessedly, the man cut him off. <b>"Oh, hello! Yes, you were staring at me on the subway, then?"</b> and he had switched to Korean, and he wasn't half-bad. His accent was quite understandable. Deming breathed a quiet sigh of relief.</p>

<p><b>"Hello, uh yes. That was me."</b></p>

<p><b>"So nice of you to call me. How are you doing? Want to get coffee with me?"</b></p>

<p><b>"Yes! Yes I'd love to."</b> This response was quite natural. Deming couldn't have been more excited to see this very, very attractive man again in a setting where they could actually talk. He gave Deming an address to a coffee shop close to a station a few stops away from his school - far enough away that Deming wasn't terribly worried about running into anyone he knew there. On his walk to the coffee shop, he was back to practicing saying Rodrigo's name under his breath. When he turned the corner, he saw the man, <i>Rodrigo</i>, waiting for him outside. He lifted his bearish hand in a wave. <b>"H-hello,"</b> Deming said.</p>

<p><b>"Hi there cutie. I wasn't sure you'd call me to be honest."</b> He held open the door for Deming and followed him inside. <b>"Get whatever you want, ok? It's on me."</b> Deming ordered himself an iced coffee and Rodrigo ordered himself a hot black coffee. They sat down across from each other, Rodrigo with a broad, pleasant smile. <b>"What's your name? I don't think I ever asked."</b></p>

<p><b>"Li Deming, ummm, wait, Deming Li. Yes. Deming."</b></p>

<p><b>"Deming is your given name then?"</b> Deming nodded in response. <b>"Got it, got it. You can call me Rodrigo, I don't mind. I never really adjusted to formal titles."</b></p>

<p>Deming nodded. <b>"Ok, R-Rodrigo, you can call me Deming then too if you'd like."</b> He felt his face heating up once again.</p>

<p>Rodrigo grinned. <b>"Damn, you're absolutely adorable Deming, do  you know that?"</b> Somehow, Deming's face got brighter in response, and he let out a nervous, awkward laugh. <b>"I'm sorry, I don't mean to make you uncomfortable, and I hope I didn't. It's the truth though, you're really fucking precious."</b></P>

<p><b>"Ah, I'm not uncomfortable. It's just...nobody has ever said something like that to me."</b></p>

<p><b>"Really? Wow, I'm kind of shocked. I think if you were in America a lot of guys would be all over you."</b></p>

<p>Deming looked up from his coffee, bright-eyed and surprised. <b>"Do you think so? And, um,  so, you like men?"</b></p>

<p>Rodrigo chuckled. <b>"Well of course. I thought that would be obvious when I grabbed your ass and gave you my number."</b></p>

<p><b>"Oh, w-well yes. That makes sense I suppose."</b></p>

<p><b>"I'm assuming you were staring at my crotch because <i>you</i> are also interested in men. Am I wrong? Or am I being too bold?"</b></p>

<p>Deming shook his head and had a sip of his coffee before continuing, <b>"No, no. You're right. I've just...I...I've never met someone else like this. I thought, perhaps, I was strange."</b></p>

<p><b>"There's nothing weird with your feelings. There are lots of people like us in the world. Is there really nobody else out at in your department? Even in anthropology, there are a handful of queer people. I guess, perhaps, they're not out that much normally, and are just out to me because I'm the unabashed gay American. What's your major?"</b></p>

<p><b>"I, uhhh..."</b> Deming trailed off. He considered lying and saying that he was studying music theory at Pusan National University, but it would be awfully awkward if he was caught in the lie. On the other hand, the truth was possibly even worse. Would Rodrigo ditch him if he realized he was in high school? The thought of losing the first, the only, gay person he had ever met was terrifying - now that he knew someone queer he wanted to pick his brain about being a gay adult. In the end, he went with honesty, because Deming knew he was a terrible liar. <b>"I'm, um, I'm in high school. I'm a senior."</b></p>

<p><b>"You're in - oh dear. Oh, of course. I should have realized from the uniform. Wow, I'm dumb, huh? How old are you?"</b></p>

<p><b>"I'm seventeen, I turn eighteen on January 7th."</b></p>

<p>Rodrigo let out a sigh, and then laughed a bit and stroked his beard. <b>"Well, not that far now, huh. I don't think I would have guessed from your looks that you're so young. Maybe it's the glasses."</b> It was the glasses, Deming would later realize. <b>"Does explain a few things though."</b></p>

<p><b>"Are you going to leave, now that you know?"</b> Deming immediately regretted the question - it had just popped out,  but he hated how pathetic it sounded. The thought of being alone though, again, without anyone, frightened him.</p>

<p><b>"What? No. We can be friends. Wait, let me be honest too. I <i>will</i> leave eventually, but today is not that day. I mentioned I think, that I study anthropology. I'm here in Korea while I finish up my dissertation. Once I finish it, I'll probably have to head back to California unless I can find a job here. I'd <i>love</i> to find one here too, Busan is a great city, but I'm not sure that it's realistic."</b>

<p><b>"I see...well, that's fine. I'm moving to Seoul next year for college."</b> Deming replied.</p>

<p><b>"That's wonderful! What school, do you know yet? Do you know what you're going to study?"</b></p>

<p><b>"Seoul Academy of the Arts. I think probably music theory. I'm not sure. But probably theory. Maybe composition if I can get into their program, but I don't think they'll accept me."</b></p>

<p><b>"Music, huh? That's cool. Do you compose or play something?"</b></p>

<p><b>"I play piano, but I'm not great. And I make weird mashups and put them on  youtube in my free time. Also, my friends started this awful band that they say is "neo-ska" genre. It's terrible, but I'm editing their songs so they don't sound quite as horrible."</b></p>

<p>Rodrigo let out a deep belly laugh. <b>"Hey, I like ska! You sound like a good friend though. Do they know you're...?"</b></p>

<p><b>"No, no. I've never told anyone about that. You're the first one to know."</b></p>

<p><b>"I'm honored that  you trust me with that, and I really mean it. When I was younger, I was afraid to tell people too. But as I've gotten older, I've realized that I want to be open about the shameless and perverted, hedonistic life I live."</b> They talked for another hour after that, the conversation flowing naturally between the two of them. Deming had never met someone that he felt comfortable talking to. He didn't even know what it meant to <i>be yourself</i> until Rodrigo had given him the space to say what was on his mind, however long it took for him to get the words out. </p>

<p>Eventually, as the sun moved behind the skyscrapers and began to set, Rodrigo told Deming he need to get to work on his dissertation and walked him back to the station. <b>"Call me again, ok? If you ever want to talk or get coffee again, I live in the area, and I'd love to hang out with you again."</b></p> Deming nodded. Rodrigo bent over, and for a moment, Deming thought he was going to kiss him, and really, really hoped he would. But then, Rodrigo kissed the top of his head, pat his shoulder, and began walking in the opposite way.</p>

<p>As Deming sat down, he pulled his glasses off and rubbed his eyes. He could feel himself tearing up, but he willed the tears away. He was too immature. Too young. He knew it, and Rodrigo certainly knew it. He made  the right decision though - lying wouldn't have worked for him. And being honest, truly honest, was refreshing. He had never felt so...so open with another person. To hear and be heard. He had never been heard before.</p>

<p>By the time Deming got home, the sun had set a couple hours ago and the house was dark. He went straight to his room, closed, and locked the door. And then he stripped in the dark and stared at his reflection in the mirror. He didn't have a body like Rodrigo, and he probably never would. Where the other was hairy muscle, radiating strength and masculinity, Deming was lanky, slender, and boyish. But, he could at least admit to himself, he wasn't unattractive. He had a nice face, long legs.</p>

<p>He went to his dresser and tried on a variety of different outfits, trying to find someting that radiated <i>I am a mature, adult gay man</i> and found that he had nothing that met his imaginative version of what this refined older man would look like.</p>

<p>The next day, after school he went shopping on his parents' dime. He bought himself a pair of jeans that reminded him of Rodrigo - slim-fitting, tight in all the right places. In the mirror, he turned around and tried to look at his ass. He grabbed his own butt with a frown. He couldn't decide if it looked flattering. Maybe he needed to do some squats. After the pants, he needed to find a top or two. Here, he wasn't sure what to do. He didn't want to outright imitate Rodrigo's style - and he didn't think  he'd look like a mature gay in a tight red polo shirt like Rodrigo did. It would probably make him look more boyish. Eventually what he found was a black long-sleeved button  up, it was form-fitting and sleek, emphasizing his slender waist and broad shoulders that he hadn't yet grown into fully. The shirt had long gray vertical lines, giving the appearance that he was a bit taller than he actually was.  The shoes were an easier decision - leather boots seemed like an obvious good choice. Deming thought back to a porn he had stumbled upon sometime last year, where a bunch of big white leather guys in silly hats and leather boots stuck their whole arms (among other things) in other guys' asses. Leather boots seemed to flag <i>I am a strong gay man and I like butts</i> to Deming at least.</P>

<p>Once he got home, with his new <i>I am a sexy gay man</i> outfit, he stripped once again and dressed himself, boots and all, and stared at himself in the mirror for at least ten minutes. He looked good. Everything he had chosen fit his body well, and he could recognize that it all looked <i>good</i> on him, but he still saw a boy staring back at himself in the mirror. He took his glasses off, took a picture of himself, and then put them back on to judge. The glasses didn't make a significant difference. He looked, perhaps, a bit more rugged without them, but not older or more refined. He took his boots off and walked over to his parents' bathroom and stole some of his mom's hair gel. He tried slicking his bangs back, but now he looked like an 80s greaser gay which wasn't quite what he was going for. Next he tried spiking his hair a bit, but still it wasn't right. This time, he looked more like a ska punk, which wasn't going to work either, because he didn't like ska and he didn't like punk. Finally, after a shower, he tried a light tousle. That didn't look half-bad. He went back to his room, put the whole outfit on again and stared in the mirror. <i>Nice. Very nice.</i> He turned around, trying to catch himself at  various angles. <i>Not boyish at all. Or, well, less boyish. Much less.</i> He took another shower and texted Rodrigo, asking if he could come over to his apartment on Saturday. Then he texted his parents and told them he was going over to a friend's house after class for the night.</p>

<p>He brought his <i>mature gay</i> outfit to school with him, and even made a bold decision to wear his leather boots with his school uniform, his pants covered the way the boots crawled up to the middle of his calves. And then after school, he ran over to a coffee shop to dress himself, stuffed his uniform in his backpack, and walked over to Rodrigo's apartment. Once he was close. He pulled out his phone and was about to dial him, before closing it, and walking over to lean against a tree. Deep breaths, deep breaths. He had thought about this all night, while he had lay awake after Rodrigo said "yep, I'm free, here's my address". He was going to do it. He was <i>not</i> a child. He was a grown, almost grown, man. With desires. And longings, and perversions, and he wanted to <i>act</i> on them. And he would. Deep breath, deep breath. It wouldn't be so hard. He just had to walk up to him and <i>show</i> Rodrigo that he wasn't just a boy.</p>

<p>Finally, after his heart had calmed down, he pulled out his phone again and called Rodrigo. <b>"I'm downstairs, will you come and meet me?"</b> Rodrigo said he'd be down in a few minutes, and Deming resisted the urge to pace as he waited.</p>

<p>A few minutes after he hung up, Deming heard a loud whistle and saw Rodrigo strutting down the stairs. <b>"Well damn kid! Look at you, you're looking sleek as fuck!"</b> Deming grinned, but kept his mouth shut, choosing not to talk and stutter - that would break the illusion. Once Rodrigo was in front of him Deming gazed up at him with a big, sly grin, and put a hand against Rodrigo's hard chest and pushed him up against the wall (in retrospect, Rodrigo definitely allowed Deming to push him). <b>"Oh my, so bold!~"</b> Deming still didn't speak, but stood on the tips of his toes and pressed his lips against Rodrigo's. Rodrigo's hands slipped around Deming's waist, his mouth inviting him in to explore. He could feel his face burning brightly, his heart pounding against his chest, as their tongues intertwined, their lips moving together. Rodrigo was a good kisser, Deming assumed (he was, in fact, a very talented kisser). And when, finally, Rodrigo pushed him forward a bit, their lips parting, Deming let out a quiet little moan as he stepped back. <b>"Wow, I was, uh, not expecting that at all."</b></p>

<p><b>"Was I...was it good?"</b> Deming looked up at him with hesitation. </p>

<p><b>"Oh yeah, no question there. I'm a bit shocked for a virgin -</b></p>

<p><b>"I'm not a virgin,"</b> Deming lied.</p>

<p><b>"Don't lie.</b></p>

<p><b>"I'm a virgin. But! But I...I don't want to be one. I really don't want to be a virgin."</b></p>

<p>Rodrigo looked around his apartment building quickly before sighing. <b>"Let's not have this conversation outside. Follow me.</b> Deming followed at his feet until they reached his apartment and took his boots off. He sat down on Rodrigo's couch and Rodrigo got Deming a glass of water, and himself a beer and sat down next to him. <b>"So what's the rush?"</b></p>

<p><b>"I like you. I think you're really hot. The night I came home after seeing you, I masturbated and thought about you fucking me."</b> This was extremely bold for Deming to say - he had never, ever in his entire life, said something as lewd and bold as this. And it was, in fact, something that he had practiced in the mirror about ten times before coming over. His face was bright red, his heart pressing against his chest as if it were ripe to explode, but he forced himself to continue. <b>"I want you to fuck me, I want to know what it feels like. I want it to be you to do it."</b></p>

<p>Rodrigo took a sip of his beer, put it down, picked it back up and took a big gulp, and then he turned and faced Deming. <b>"You're really sexy Deming. I've always had a soft spot for kind of nerdy guys who don't realize that they're exceptionally hot, and you kind of hit all my kinks. I like younger guys too, I'll be honest. But...you're in high school. And, as you said, I'm the first gay man you've <i>ever</i> met. I just..."</b></p>

<p><b>"I'm over the age of consent if that's what you're worried about."</b> Deming had looked it up earlier. <b>"And I-I...I really want you. I really like you! I've never met anyone as cool as you."</b></p>

<p><b>"I think you're pretty cool too. And you're really hot, but  -"</b> Rodrigo looked over at Deming, who placed his hand on Rodrigo's leg and looked up at him with the softest, most adorable and adorably horny look on his face, and Rodrigo crumbled. He leaned in, ran a thumb against Deming's cheek, before tipping his chin up and slowly, tenderly kissing him. </p>

<hr>

<p>The first time Deming had sex with Rodrigo, later that night, long after Rodrigo sucked him off, was the first time in Deming's life that he had ever felt loved. Rodrigo was a fantastic lover (and in retrospect, almost fifteen years later, still the best lover Deming had ever had). That first time, he moved slowly, prepared Deming thoroughly, checking in with him to make sure he was ok, that he really wanted it. And, oh god, he <i>did</i> want it, he had never wanted anything more in his life. And afterwards, Rodrigo fell asleep holding Deming, his head resting against Rodrigo's hairy chest, he listened to the other's heartbeats, those strong, powerful arms wrapped around his body. It was the best sleep he had ever had.</p>

<p>While it was the first time Deming had ever felt loved, he wasn't instantly <i>in love</i> with Rodrigo. That came much later. Rodrigo was nothing but a good influence on Deming. After that first time, Rodrigo felt it necessary to lay down some ground rules. Deming could come over on school nights, but he couldn't sleep over and had to leave at 10pm. He also made Deming do homework for a few hours whenever he came over - this had the added benefit of giving Rodrigo time to work on his dissertation. On weekends, they spent almost the entire time together, though Rodrigo made him go home for at least one morning or afternoon so that he could, presumably, see his parents. Though when Deming got home on those afternoons, it typically was a quick "hello" and then up to his room to take a shower and a nap before going out again later. His parents had few questions for him - he figured they were just happy that he had a friend he liked to spend so much time with. They never bothered asking normal parent questions like "What's his name, where does he live?" It didn't matter - Deming was clearly safe enough.</p>

<p>There was one particular instance that was very awkward to deal with his parents. Deming had been busy for almost an entire week with schoolwork and editing his friends' neo-ska mixtape. When he finally was free from his responsibilities, Deming <i>ran</i> to the station, and then ran some more to Rodrigo's apartment. As soon as Rodrigo opened the door, Deming closed it shut quickly, and got down on his knees, unbuttoning Rodrigo's fly with a skill he had practiced over the course of the past three months. <b>"Hungry, huh? This has probably been the longest we've gone without seeing each other."</b></p>

<p><b>"I've been so busy and depressed. It's terrible. I've been thinking about this every night - I could barely sleep last night, knowing I'd finally be free."</b> Deming slipped his hands into Rodrigo's pants, grabbing his underwear too and pulling them both down at the same time. Rodrigo's big dick, still soft, bounced out of its confines and Deming gave it a few long licks to get it wet before taking the whole thing in his mouth.</p>

<p>Rodrigo let out a deep grunt as his dick quickly hardened in Deming's mouth. <b>"Ahhh, damn. You've gotten <i>real</i> good at this. I didn't fuck anyone else either, this whole week."</b></p>

<p>Deming glanced up at him, slowly slid his mouth to the tip of Rodrigo's cock before finally letting it fall out of his mouth. <b>"I hope I was worth the wait,"</b> Deming said with a grin, before focusing back on the hard dick in front of him.</p>

<p><b>"Ohhh yes, well worth the wait."</b> Deming spent a few focused minutes on the tip of Rodrigo's dick, playing with Rodrigo's piercing with his tongue before taking it to the back of his throat. After three months of practice, he had gotten to the point where he could <i>usually</i> control his gag reflex. He felt Rodrigo's big hand in his hair, his hand pushing Deming to take him just a little bit deeper, and he felt the piercing push against his the back of his throat, the cold steel a sharp contrast to the hot intensity of Rodrigo's cock. Deming unbuttoned and pulled his pants down, and for a quick moment, released Rodrigo's cock from his hot mouth and spit on his hands, and jerked himself off as Rodrigo started thrusting in his throat.</p>

<p>The tension inside him quickly built up - a whole week without Rodrigo and his big dick had made him so hungry that he tried to pace himself, to try to time his own orgasm with Rodrigo's. But he could also tell from the way that Rodrigo's hand had fisted his hair, steadying him on his dick as he tried to control his thrusting, that the older man was close too. Rodrigo had two hands around the back of Deming's head and neck, pushing him further and further onto his dick and back as he fucked Deming's mouth with abandon. And then, finally, a deep moan came from the older man, timed with a strong, hard thrust and a <i>crunch</i> as Deming's face was pushed right into Rodrigo. <b>"Ohh, oh shit, was that your -"</b> Rodrigo said through some grunts as his come poured down Deming's throat. Deming paid it no mind, and one hand grabbed onto Rodrigo's thick ass to hold him in place as he jerked himself to completion, moaning around Rodrigo's dick.</p>

<p>Finally, after a few long moments of cum-swallowing and coating his hand and the floor with his own cum, Deming let go of Rodrigo's ass and sat back on his heels. Deming took his glasses off and squinted at them. <b>"Fuck, I am <i>so</i> sorry. I'll take you to get some new ones ASAP."</b></p>

<p>Deming frowned, and gazed in the direction of the shape of Rodrigo. <b>"Don't worry about it. I'll get my prescription from my parents and go buy myself a new pair."</b> </p>

<p><b>"Can you still see?"</b> Deming put his broken glasses back on, and while they were bent badly in the middle, with multiple long cracks in the lenses, he could still mostly see.</p>

<p><b>"Well enough to make it home. I probably shouldn't stay over tonight though,"</b> Deming said, ending with a very dejected sigh.</p>

<p><b>"Fuck, I feel so bad. I kinda got wrapped up in the moment -"</b></p>

<p>Deming stood up with a grin and kissed Rodrigo, nice and slow, before pulling away. <b>"Don't worry about it. I'm not upset. <i>This</i> was well-worth it for me. I should probably head home early though, before it gets dark. I have an old pair at home I can use for the weekend, but they're not strong enough for school."</b></p>

<p>Rodrigo accompanied Deming to the station, and once they were there he asked Deming if his parents would be mad. Deming shrugged. <b>"They'll probably give me a lecture."</b></p>

<p><b>"Do you want me to walk you home? I don't mind."</b></p>

<p>Deming shook his  head. <b>"Don't worry about it. I'll call you tomorrow though, I should be free."</b> Rodrigo pulled him in for a big hug - the usual way they said goodbye to each other when they were in public, and then grabbed his ass for good measure.</p>

<p>On his walk home, Deming tried to figure out what he was going to tell his parents. With any luck, they wouldn't be home and he could mull over it for the night before getting his prescription in the morning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as he unlocked the door to their apartment, he realized luck was not on his side. The lights were on, and his dad's work shoes were in the hallway. Deming sighed as he took his shoes off and braced himself for a real grumpy father. He walked into the kitchen and sat down across from his father.</P>

<p><b>"I didn't expect to see you today, son."</b></p>

<p><b>"Father..."</b> Deming trailed off, and finally his father looked up from his laptop.</p>

<P><b>"What happened to  your glasses?"</b></p>

<p><b>"I, uh, I walked into a door."</b></p>

<p><b>"You walked into a door?"</b> It was a question, but phrased as a statement. Deming nodded and looked down at the table. <b>"And how exactly did you manage to do that?"</b></p>

<p><b>"I was very focused on what I was listening to."</b></p>

<p><b>"And what were you listening to?"</b></p>

<p><b>"My friends' mixtape"</b></p>

<p>His father crossed his arms. <b>"You said you finished editing that yesterday."</b></p>

<p>Deming nodded. <b>"I did, but I was listening to it again to make sure it was as polished as I could make it."</b></p>

<p>His father's frown deepened. <b>"It's good of you to double and triple check your work. But you should pay attention to your surroundings."</b> Deming nodded. <b>"We just bought that pair this year. A new pair will come out of your allowance."</b> Deming nodded again. <b>"I'll find your prescription later so you can get a new pair tomorrow."</b></p>

<p><b>"Thank you."</b> Deming stood up and started walking in the direction of his room. He heard his father groan, some papers shuffling, and then it seemed he was back to work once again.</p>

<hr>

<p>After eight months of hanging out, having dinner, and copious amounts of sex with Rodrigo, Deming thought of him as his boyfriend. He never said the words though - he had learned over time that Rodrigo eschewed labels for the most part. He had also learned that Rodrigo had a partner back home that he referred to as his husband, though they weren't legally married. He had told Deming quite a bit about him, and their life back home. He was an older man (even older than Rodrigo), a programmer, and they both were open about having other boyfriends in addition to each other. In fact, Rodrigo told him that his husband had a long-term boyfriend that he called <i>boy</i>, and Rodrigo expected that his husband was very much in love with his boy. He had even confessed that he wondered, if and when he ever went back to America, if his husband would have left him completely to be with his boy.</p>

<p>Even though Deming knew that he was married, that he had a husband back home, he couldn't help his own feelings. Rodrigo had become his closest friend, his confidante, and he even thought about trying to get a visa so he could go home with him. He recognized this as a dream though - would Rodrigo even want him, when he was back home?</p>

<p>Rodrigo had taken Deming out to a late night diner for some greasy food after a long and intense night of fucking. They sat across from each other, Deming poking at some eggs with a fork. He looked back and forth between his food and Rodrigo. The whole night, Deming felt that something was a bit odd, but he couldn't put his finger on anything specific.</p>

<p>Rodrigo caught Deming's eyes glancing at him, and he steepled his fingers in front of his face. <b>"Deming, I need to talk to you about something."</b> Deming lifted his head and looked at Rodrigo, who had a large frown on his bearded face. <b>"It's good news and bad news, I suppose. I got a postdoctoral fellowship - it's at a very good university back home, and the pay is...well, more than I've ever made in  my life. It's a rare opportunity."</b></p>

<p><b>"Congratulations."</b> Deming had a sense of what was coming next, though he wasn't prepared for it.</p>

<p><b>"Thanks, it's a really great opportunity for me. I can't pass it up - academic jobs are getting tight back home, so this will help my career prospects a lot once I finish my fellowship. But...well...I've already accepted it. And bought my ticket home."</b></p>

<p>Deming blinked hard a few times before speaking. <b>"When?"</b> was in the end all he was able to say.</p>

<p><b>"I've a month and a half to wrap everything up here before I go home."</b> Deming blinked a few more times, but it didn't help. Tears welled up in his eyes, breaking, and streamed down his face. He cried silently, not even sniffling, but the tears flowed freely. <b>"Deming, please don't - I'm sorry, I mean, I'm sorry I just told you now.  But I was always clear with you - this all, it was never going to last. I have to go home eventually."</b></p>

<p>Deming's tears kept flowing, and he cleared his throat before speaking, but his voice still cracked. <b>"I love you,"</b> he said. Words he had been repressing, from himself, from Rodrigo, for many months now.</p>

<p>Rodrigo sighed. <b>"Look - you're young. You should get out there and enjoy life. You're about to go to college, and we were going to need to break this off anyways. Go out, fuck a lot of different guys and figure out what you like and how you like it. You can't get that all from me."</b></p>

<p>Deming took his glasses off and kept crying. He couldn't see anything at all. <b>"I love you, Rodrigo. I was going to postpone my attendance."</b> He picked up a napkin and wiped his face and eyes, but he still kept crying.</p>

<p><b>"No, no. Look - you're a catch. You're just saying this because I'm all you've ever had. But there are a lot of guys in the world - in Busan, and in Seoul, for you to get to know. There is a guy out there who is going to make you so happy, give you so much more than I ever could. I know it. This, this all, it's just fun for both of us. I've had fun, and I hope you have too,"</b> Deming nodded in response, and wiped his eyes again with his soaked napkin. It didn't help. <b>"It's time for you to go out into the world and experience a bunch of different things, have sex with all kinds of different people and bodies. Now that you have some experience, sex with strangers will be really fun. You'll see. And you're too young to settle down anyways. I would have been mad had you postponed your attendance."</b></p>

<p>Deming finally put his glasses back on and blinked a few more times. He still couldn't really see around his tears, but he stood up anyways. <b>"I'm going."</b></p>

<p><b>"Hey now, where are you going? Look, I know this news sucks,  but it had to happen sometime and you know it, deep down, you know this wasn't forever. I <i>hope</i> you knew that."</b></p>

<p><b>"I knew. I'm going home."</b> was all Deming could manage without his voice cracking too horribly. <b>"I'll come around before you leave."</b></p> Deming turned around and started walking towards the exit. Behind him, he heard Rodrigo sigh, and then sniffle a bit. He kept going, and once he was out of the diner he started running. He ran aimlessly, and he wasn't sure for how long, before he finally found a park. He sat on a bench and buried his face in his hands, letting himself cry for real now, long, loud sobs until he was so dehydrated he couldn't cry anymore. And then, as the sun started to rise up into the sky, Deming got up and made his way to the station, and snuck into his room before his parents woke up, buried his face in his pillow, and cried some more. 

<hr>

<p>Deming had taken a couple weeks to himself after hearing the news. He was so visibly dejected even his parents had asked him what was wrong. He gave them a vague "had a disagreement with a friend" line and left it at that. As usual, neither of them had the desire or the emotional intelligence to pry. But after a couple weeks of moping and coping, he started going back over to Rodrigo's on the weekends. He kept himself busy on the weekdays, staying home some nights to work on his music, and on evenings when he was especially horny, he scoped out a few clubs that didn't check IDs. He'd found that Rodrigo was right - he <i>did</i> enjoy fooling around with other guys. He never took it all the way though - satisfied with some grinding and making out, and occasionally a quick blowjob in a seedy bathroom.</p>

<p>The month and a half quickly went by though, and finally in the middle of June, Deming realized his time with Rodrigo had come to a close. For one final night, he made his way over to Rodrigo's apartment and let himself in. Rodrigo was busy sweeping the kitchen. The apartment was bare and depressing - only the furniture was left, all of his personal items had already been mailed back home, or were in his two large bags in front of the door. Deming sat down on the couch - a couch with many good memories, the strongest being his first blowjob ever - and sighed. He was prepared, emotionally, and he was going to try his damnedest not to cry, but seeing the naked apartment that he had spent many very pleasurable days in for the past nine and a half months totally bare and naked was more depressing than he expected.</p>

<p>Rodrigo came over with two beers in his hands and passed one over to Deming. <b>"Just this once, I'll let you drink with me. I need to clean out my fridge."</b> Deming turned it around in his hands a few times before opening it. <b>"I'm glad you came by, I wasn't sure if you would."</b></p>

<p>Deming had a sip of his beer, frowned, then had another drink. It wasn't the greatest thing he had ever drank, but he was determined to drink it all nonetheless. <b>"I wanted to see you one last time before you left."</b></p>

<p><b>"Me too. I'm going to miss you a lot. Hey, hold on, I have something for you."</b> Rodrigo got up and started digging around in his bags before pulling out a large, padded package. <b>"I thought I might need to mail it to your school once you move. Go ahead and open it."</b></p>

<p>Deming stared at the package for a few moments before finally tearing it open. It was a big, beautiful and brand new black leather jacket. <b>"Oh wow, Rodrigo. This is really nice, thank you."</b></p>

<p><b>"Try it on! Oh I'm dying to see you in it."</b> Deming put it on over his polo shirt. It fit well, for the most part, but a bit big in the shoulders. <b>"I tried to take a guess on the size. I wanted it to be something you could mature into. Damn, you look very sexy. Boys will be calling you <i>sir</i> in no time."</b></p>

<p><b>"Do you really think so? I don't look silly?"</b></p>

<p><b>"Nope, not at all. And  you wear a lot of black as it is. You wear it well."</b> Deming grinned, and walked over to straddle Rodrigo as he sat on the couch. He put two hands to Rodrigo's face and kissed him, slow and easy. It was one of those kisses that stretched on and on, neither of them parting from the other, as if they were in no rush. Eventually, Deming pulled back just a bit, feeling hardness against him, and feeling that he had also hardened through the many minutes of their tender kissing. 

<p><b>"I-I want you to fuck me raw tonight,"</b> Deming said, breathless still from the kiss.</p>

<p>Rodrigo shook his head. <b>"It's important to wear condoms. I know you know this."</b></p>

<p> Deming frowned. <b>"I know! And I wouldn't ask anyone else. But I got tested earlier this week, and I haven't fooled around with anyone since. Everything came back negative, and it's the last time we'll ever get the chance, so..."</b>  He trailed off, and gazed at Rodrigo, trying his best to look innocent.</p>

<p><b>"You don't know that <i>I</i> got tested recently though."</b> Deming lifted an eyebrow in response. Early in their relationship, Rodrigo had set a variety of ground rules - not just for their relationship, but also advice for Deming going forward in his life as a sexually active gay man. Get tested often, don't have unprotected sex, and don't trust your partner to always give you the truth about their status. With this, though, Rodrigo also told him that while he really <i>shouldn't</i> trust every guy to be honest about his status, Rodrigo religiously got tested every couple of weeks, a habit that he had started during the AIDS crisis in the US, and one that stuck with him since. Rodrigo sighed. <b>"Okay, you got me. I got tested earlier this week and everything was clean too. But I still don't think -"</b></p>

<p><b>"Rodrigo, please, just this one time."</b> Deming grabbed the collar of Rodrigo's shirt, and looked at him with wide, soft eyes. <b>"I'll never ask you again - I won't even have the chance. I just want to know what it would feel like, you and me, without anything in between us."</b>

<p>Rodrigo took his time to respond, as Deming desperately clutched to his collar, his face mere inches away from Rodrigo's. Eventually, Rodrigo crumbled against the onslaught of Deming's intense cuteness. He wrapped his arms around Deming's waist and leaned closer, their noses brushing against each other, until Deming pushed forward, their lips meeting in a heated, desperate kiss. Rodrigo grabbed Deming's ass and scoped him up from the couch, carrying him over to his bed, where he laid down Deming and continued to kiss him as they both tried to swiftly undress each other without having to leave the tantalizing confines of each other's mouths.</p>

<p>Deming had managed to unbutton Rodrigo's fly quite quickly, sticking his hand into the older man's pants and finding his dick, hard from the kissing, the straddling, and pulled it out from his pants. Rodrigo finally pulled away from Deming's lips to pull his shirt off, and Deming quickly followed suit, shedding his new leather jacket and his polo shirt as fast as he could. Rodrigo made quick work of Deming's pants, before hastily shedding his own. <b>"If I wasn't leaving tomorrow..."</b> Rodrigo trailed off, but the implication was clear. This wasn't something he did with everyone.</p>

<p>Deming propped himself up on his elbows, a slight smile on his face. <b>"I know,</b> he said, before pushing Rodrigo down on the bed, bending over, and taking his whole, hard cock into his mouth. He paid special attention to the pierced head, the cold steel that he had grown so fond of - something he had not seen in the twenty or so cocks that he had sucked since Rodrigo had told him he was moving back to the US.</P>

<p>Rodrigo let out a long, deep moan before pushing Deming off of his dick. <b>"You're good, but...no. Come here, I want to suck you off too."</b> Deming turned around, keeping himself on top as he positioned his own dick near Rodrigo's face, and took Rodrigo's cock back into his mouth. He felt Rodrigo's hot mouth claim his own dick, and couldn't contain a long, drawn out moan as Rodrigo licked up, down, and then rubbed his tongue in the slit of Deming's cock. He felt his dick twitch from the feeling - Rodrigo <i>knew</i> after all this time, that it was one of the most sensitive parts of Deming's dick - a place that, if enough time was spent, he would be writhing, crying, and twitching in horny agony. </p>

<p>Deming tried to contain himself -  he tried his absolute best to not thrust into Rodrigo's mouth, knowing that too much movement would push himself over the edge well before he was prepared to lose it. But neither of them had the stamina this night, that was clear. They both sucked each other off without any rhythm, no sense to try to keep the other from cumming too fast. Rodrigo had taken all of Deming's dick, and he felt the head of his cock push into the back of Rodrigo's throat as the older man spread his asscheeks and played with his ass as he slid his mouth up and down Deming's dick. Deming tried his best to match Rodrigo's pace, but he had absolutely no rhythm - fast, slow, tip, base, didn't matter. He wanted all of him, in him, near him, around him.</p> 

<p>With absolutely no warning, Rodrigo flipped their positions, and pressed Deming down hard on the  bed. He pushed Deming's legs up, and spread Deming's asscheeks, his tongue finding Deming's tight hole. <b>"Ohhhhh nooooooo,"</b> Deming moaned out as Rodrigo's tongue invaded his hot insides. Rodrigo kept a hand on Deming's dick, stroking it slowly, infuriatingly slowly. Deming tried to focus on sucking Rodrigo's dick and playing with his balls, but his focus was completely shot now - he could barely do much of anything besides just hold Rodrigo's cock in his mouth and play with that pierced head that he loved so much. Just a few minutes of focused attention on Deming's asshole and that was all it took to make him start squirming and panting around Rodrigo's thick dick. He had to push himself away - <b>"R-Rodrigo, please..."</b> he trailed off into a deep, throaty moan as Rodrigo slipped in a couple fingers with his tongue, stretching and playing at the same time. <b>"Oh god..."</b> Deming gave up, letting his head hit the pillow. He couldn't anymore - as much as he wanted to, he couldn't. His focus was all gone, once that second finger slipped its way in next to Rodrigo's cruel tongue. </p>

<p>Rodrigo pulled his tongue away, but replaced it with an additional thick finger, which elicited another deep, throaty moan from Deming. <b>"Wow, already begging, huh?"</b> Rodrigo glanced between Deming's legs with a big grin.</p>

<p><b>"D-don't play with me!"</b> Deming cried between pants. <b>"You <i>know</i> I lose my mind when you eat my ass out!"</b></p>

<p><b>"Oh I do, I do."</b> Rodrigo added a fourth finger and felt Deming tighten against him. <b>"You'll need to beg a bit more if you want my dick though."</b></p>

<p><b>"Rodrigo! You're - ahhhh - you're killing me!"</b></p>

<p<b>"That doesn't sound like begging to me,"</b> Rodrigo said as he curled his fingers, rubbing right against Deming's prostate. He couldn't help the quick thrust up, and as he rolled down, he rolled his hips right into Rodrigo's fingers. Fuck, this was...not going well.</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Deming was already completely undone. He could feel himself shaking, and as much as he wanted to take that big dick dangling in front of his face into his mouth again, he couldn't manage to get his face high enough to reclaim it. It seemed as though Rodrigo had angled himself <i>just so</i>, in the perfect place to be just out of reach. <b>"God...damn it Rodrigo!"</b> Deming cried as he felt himself thrusting again into Rodrigo's cruel fingers, trying to guide them to that most tender and sensual place inside of him. Rodrigo was skilled though, he touched that place a couple of times and then kept his fingers far away to force Deming to beg. And his fighting spirit was crushed, once again. He found himself thinking, briefly, distractedly, to that time that Rodrigo had edged him for two hours. How cruel his lover could be, when inspired to force Demimg to pass his own limits. <b>"Please - p-please fuck me! I can't, I can't -"</b></p>

<p>Finally, he felt Rodrigo pull his fingers away, and he couldn't help but gasp as he felt himself become so thoroughly <i>empty</i> without those fingers. Rodrigo reached over and grabbed a bottle of conveniently-placed lube from his nightstand and poured a generous amount on his dick. And then he paused. looking down at Deming. <b>"You sure? It's not too late for me to put on a -"</b></p>

<p><b>"Don't you <i>dare</i>,"</b> Deming said as he reached up and wrapped his hands around Rodrigo's neck, pulling him down for a hasty, messy kiss. But it didn't last - Rodrigo pulled away after a moment and stroked his lube-covered dick a couple times before pressing the pierced tip against Deming's hole. Deming felt himself start to shake, feeling that hot dick rubbing against his entrance. He squirmed for a few moments before, again, he realized Rodrigo was messing with him again. <b>"P-please, put it in! I-I can'-t -"</b> that seemed to be the thing that Rodrigo was waiting for, because Deming's begging was cut off by a loud moan that may have woken up his neighbors. Deming was filled completely by the hot hardness that was Rodrigo's dick. And it really, <i>really</i> did feel amazing with nothing between them. Amazing, and amazingly <i>addictive</i>.  Deming suddenly, acutely, understood why Rodrigo had been so hesitant about fucking him raw. Protection aside, the feeling was unparalleled. He could feel viscerally every twitch, every movement. The way Rodrigo's pierced head slammed into his prostate, again and again. <i>Hell</i>, he was not going to last long like this. 
</p>

<p>It was almost unfair, how Rodrigo knew Deming's body so thoroughly. He knew it better than Deming knew his own body at this point in his young life, and he could feel when Deming was getting close, far too fast, he'd slow down, keeping his dick at Deming's entrance, so he'd feel stretched, but agonizingly unfulfilled. And then, when Deming's moaning had quieted a bit, when his breathing had started to slow down, he'd push back in all the way, slamming mercilessly into his prostate over and over. Slowly though, Deming found himself becoming acclimated, and with a focus that was quite unusual for him, he was able to notice the way that Rodrigo's dick swelled a bit and started twitching. He could <i>feel</i> Rodrigo start to leak inside him, the hot precum lubing up his insides.</p>

<p>And that was when Deming started to lose it. As much as he wanted to hold out, to enjoy this final moment between the two of them, he couldn't contain himself, couldn't stop his hips from meeting Rodrigo as he thrusted. He impaled himself over and over against Rodrigo's dick, and he felt Rodrigo start to lose himself too, his thrusts becoming erratic, his cock spitting more and more precum, until finally, Rodrigo pushed all the way in with a loud, deep grunt, and spilled all of his seed in Deming's ass. He brought a big hand to Deming's dick at the same time, giving him two quick thrusts, and rubbed his thumb over the slit of Deming's dick, which had him screaming as he came all over Rodrigo's hand and his own stomach.</p>

<p>After his long, incredibly loud scream, Deming looked up at Rodrigo with a big fucked-out grin, and Rodrigo bent over and kissed him, so slowly and sloppily, until his dick softened inside of Deming's ass and finally fell out on its own accord. It was the first time that Deming had ever enjoyed the sensation of cum leaking out of his asshole, and he felt so incredibly spent, used, and <i>happy</i>, so incredibly happy. They laid like that for a long time, covered in each other's sweat and cum, kissing messily as their breathing returned to normal.</p>

<p>Eventually Rodrigo pulled away and the two of them just stared at each other, Deming with a big stupid grin on his face, until Rodrigo lightly smacked his ass. <b>"Let's go shower,"</b> he said, helping Deming get up from the bed. His legs were incredibly wobbly - he felt, suddenly, like a newly-deflowered virgin once again.</p>

<p>The two of them took their time showering together, enjoying the steam, and the company, and then after a lengthy shower, got dressed and had another beer each as Deming helped Rodrigo finish tidying up his apartment. It was the wee hours of the morning, when Rodrigo looked at the the time on his phone, and then to Deming. <b>"So...I should probably call a taxi soon."</b></p>

<p>Deming nodded - he knew this was coming, after all. <b>"I'll wait with you until it's here."</b> And the two of them finished off the last remnants of drinks in Rodrigo's fridge and took out the last few bits of trash. And then, finally, Rodrigo's taxi came and Deming helped him take his bags to the car.</P>

<p>They stood outside of the taxi for a few minutes, the moon high in the sky, staring down at them, as they stared at each other. <b>"I'm gonna miss you."</b> Rodrigo finally said.</p>

<p>Deming was determined not to start crying until Rodrigo left, but he could feel his eyes begging for their own release now, in the dark of night. <b>"I'm going to miss you too. Um...thank you. For everything."</b></p>

<p><b>"Thank you too. You made me feel a lot less lonely these past months. Stay in touch, ok?"</b> Deming nodded, and Rodrigo bent down to give him one final, slow kiss, patted his head, and then got in the taxi.</p>

<p>Deming stood where he was for quite some time. Long after the taxi disappeared in the mess of cars on the road. He stood there, alone, outside of the apartment that was once Rodrigo's, the apartment he had been going to at least once a week or more for the past nine and a half months. He glanced over at the staircase to Rodrigo's apartment and found himself thinking about that first time, when he was shaking in his new outfit, waiting for Rodrigo to come down, when...when he propositioned the older man  and convinced him to take his virginity.</p>

<p>That was when he, finally, started crying. The tears that he had held back for the whole night came out in earnest. He took off his glasses and stared up at the sky, the vague light of the moon, and let himself feel all of the feelings. Loud, deep sobs. That first time, it really was the first time he had ever felt like he was loved by another human being. He had never felt that way before, and he suddenly questioned whether he would feel that way again.</p>

<p>But, Deming was young, just halfway past eighteen years. He would realize, a few days later when he was being fucked by a very muscular guy in a love hotel, that he could feel something akin to love from another (nameless) man, even if he wasn't <i>in love</i> with him like Rodrigo. He could chase after some ephemeral figment of what that first time felt like with any guy he could find. It, he, would rarely ever be as good as his first. How could he? Rodrigo was the <i>first</i> one to make him feel that way. But he could find something similar.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>"I guess, you could say that I really took Rodrigo's words to heart, to go out and have sex with a variety of different men."</b></p>

<p>His therapist nodded. <b>"Yes it...certainly seems like you did exactly that."</b> She glanced over at the clock on her table, just a few minutes before the top of the hour. <b>"It seems we're about out of time. Let's continue this conversation next week."</b> Deming nodded, paid her, and then went out of the building. He glanced up at the sky and rubbed the bridge of his nose. It had been so long since he thought of Rodrigo, even though he wore that leather jacket Rodrigo had given him so many years ago just about every time he went out cruising. And then Deming pulled his phone out of his pocket and went on grindr. He had the night to himself, and all that reminiscing about his tender first love made him want to get fucked brutally - bottoming was something he hadn't indulged in for a at least two months now. Time to chase that high, once again, and crash so hard in the wee hours of the night. </p>
