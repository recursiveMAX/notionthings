<p>Deming was once again sitting across from his therapist. He wondered, briefly, what he was even doing in therapy. He <i>knew</i>, technically-speaking, why he was there. He was very depressed, very, very depressed. And, perhaps, a sex addict. A person with a compulsion for seeking out no-strings-attached sex at any opportunity he could. But, after five sessions diving into his first boyfriend, his compulsions, his maligned disposition towards his job, he wasn't feeling any better. If he was being honest with himself, he was pretty sure he felt worse consistently after therapy. But maybe that was how it worked? You feel worse until you feel better?</p>

<p>But how much worse could Deming feel about himself?</p>

<p>His therapist took a couple notes on his clipboard before finally turning to him. <b>"Today, I think it would be beneficial for us to discuss your somewhat-recent breakup. You mentioned that your ex was, I quote, 'a cheating pig, a lout, and a giant asshole'. Would it be safe to assume at one point though, he was a decent person?"</b></p>

<p>Deming sat back and crossed his arms. <b>"Sure, he was fine at one point. More than fine. We used to have a decent relationship. Well...actually, we never really were in a relationship - I mean, we were, ostensibly, boyfriends. But it was something that happened over a long period of time."</b></p>

<p>The therapist nodded and took a couple of notes. <b>"How exactly did that develop then? What pushed you from being...whatever you were before, to what you became?"</b></p>

<p><b>"There were a variety of factors. Junha and I fooled around on and off for a few months. It started off casual, like most of my relationships do. We had sex, it was good, and that was that. And then, I'd go out to the club, and I'd see him, and we'd end up hooking up again. And again. And then, eventually, it seemed like every week we'd be hooking up. And then, after that, he started staying at my place, and from there, more of his stuff ended up in my room. Then, finally, he asked my roommate and me if he could cut his lease and just live with me. In retrospect...I definitely should have said no. But I didn't, and my roommate - S, let's call her - I think she felt bad, because she had previously had a girlfriend living with us, and I was, well, alone like I usually am. She said it was fine too, and I really do think it was because she pitied me, but alas. He moved in. Things were fine, better than fine actually. It was great, having him around, waking up next to him. The two of us coming home drunk after drinking with our bosses. And then...it started getting..well. Not fine."</b></p>

<p><b>"Where do  you feel like it started going downhill?"</b></p>

<p>Deming sighed and crossed his arms. <b>"The whole thing was always downhill, I think. It was...look, I'll be blunt since I've been being blunt with you and you've yet to client-fire me,"</b> his therapist laughed at this, and nodded for him to continue. <b>"The sex was phenomenal. We're both they type of people who like to make others feel good. So, the sex was consistently very wonderful. And Junha is a person like me - he likes sex, has a high sex-drive. And that was kind of the basis for our relationship. We wanted to fuck each other all the time. And then..."</b></p>

<p>Deming paused for a long while as his therapist stared at him. Eventually, she prodded him, and he found it in himself to continue. <b>"Make-up sex is great. I mean, being mad at the person you're fucking, and taking that out in a highly-consensual and mutually beneficial way? Excellent. When we first started dating, he was a talent manager for another entertainment group, and he was very good at his job. Some days, he'd come home, say some acutely rude words to me, I'd get mad, and then I'd fuck the life out of him. And then afterwards, he'd apologize, we'd laugh about it, and go to sleep, or fuck some more and then sleep after. At a certain point though, he decided he wanted to go to grad school. That's when things started getting tense."</b></p>

<hr>

<p>Li Deming hadn't seen his partner in what felt like a week, at least. It wasn't the first time since Park Junha had started grad school - not even close. It seemed like it was almost every week now though, that he didn't see his boyfriend. Even though they lived together - he lived with Deming rent-free specifically. Deming had ran out of his office right at 5pm, hoping he might be able to get home and see Junha, and perhaps even convince Junha to fuck him (something that hadn't happened in, god, five whole days), but when he unlocked the door, he knew he was in for a disappointing night again.</p>

<p><b>"He's not home, if that's why you ran from the station."</b> Sohyun said from the couch, their plump cat sitting on her lap.</p>

<p>Deming groaned, both at his roommate, who knew him far too well, and at Junha, who was once again busy studying. Deming grabbed a beer from the refrigerator and sat down next to Sohyun. <b>"Noona, I'm never going to get laid again."</b></p>

<p>Sohyun punched him lightly in the arm. <b>"If that actually happened, you'd die for sure. He stopped by today and I have the <i>privilege</i> of sharing his note with you. He said, and I quote, with accuracy mind you: 'please ask Deming to make dinner by 9pm, I'll be home at that point'. I'm sorry, Deming, but there is nothing about your happy ending here."</b></p>

<p><b>"Yeah, I'm definitely never getting laid again. God damn it, I didn't sign up to be this guy's butler. For fuck's sake."</b></p>

<p><b>"He's a shit, Dede."</b> Sohyun grabbed Deming's beer and took a nice swig before giving it back to him. <b>"I'm also not his, or your, messenger. Y'all have phones."</b></p>

<p><b>"He says he can't use it in the library."</b></p>

<p><b>"Oh fuck that. I know he's at a good school and all that, but that's bullshit."</b> Sohyun frowned and muted the TV where a news anchor was interviewing some fresh-faced eighteen year old. <b>"Like I definitely saw people sucking dick in the library, you can use a phone in there."</b></p>

<p><b>"Wait, you saw people sucking dick there? Which library? Damn, I never got to do that."</b></p>

<p>Sohyun snickered, <b>"Yeah but you've sucked dick like, everywhere else in this town. I think it's fine if you missed out on the library."</b> Deming nodded. It was true, and he had no comeback. <b>"So, what are you making us for dinner? I was going to cook tonight until Junha came by and gave me his proclamation."</b></p>

<P>Deming polished off his beer. <b>"Fried rice, I guess. Too lazy to make anything else. You know, they decided to pull me into pre-production today? I had to be in a recording room with the most insufferable teenager. Every ten minutes, he was crying for a break."</b> Deming scoffed as he got up, and their cat opened one blue eye at him, before deciding that even Deming wasn't worth her attention, and went back to sleep. Deming went into the kitchen, took off his tie and long-sleeved shirt, and threw an apron on over his undershirt. <b>"And then my boss was trying to marshal everyone into going out and getting wasted. I literally, <i>literally</i>, noona, I snuck out of there because I can only deal with drinking with him once a week."</b></p>

<P><b>"Well, you can drink with me, dear. And on that note - will you get me a beer? I'd do it myself, but, you know, cat."</b> Deming grabbed both Sohyun and himself more beers and took one over to her. He'd butler for  her and the cat, but not for Junha, he didn't deserve it. <b>"Were  you stuck with the teenager all day then?"</b></p>

<p><b>"Yes!"</b> Deming cried. <b>"All fucking day. If he had just a few grams of professionalism we would have been done by morning. You know, I don't even know why I bothered. I could have just done some overtime today and I'd be fine, but now I'm going to have to go in early tomorrow to catch up on the piece I was working on yesterday. All because I thought, 'oh Junha said he'd be home at a reasonable hour today since his midterm was this morning', but no, stupid Deming, how dare you think your partner actually would want to see you."</b> Deming aggressively chopped up an onion - so aggressively in fact, that the cat was offended enough at the <i>chop chop chop</i> to get up from Sohyun's lap and stalk into her bedroom for a quieter nap. </p>

<p>Sohyun carried her beer into the kitchen and sat down at their table, propping an elbow up on the table. <b>"You know, I'm so tired of you two. It's like the same thing. He's going to come home tonight, and you're going to scold him, then he's going to say like, you're obsessed with seeing your boyfriend, or you don't care how he does in school, then you'll get mopey, he'll apologize, and then y'all will go to bed, you <i>won't</i> get your happy ending, and we'll play the same game tomorrow."</b></p>

<p>Deming paused his aggressive chopping. <b>"Damn, noona, tell me how you really feel."</b></p>

<P><b>"Look, I don't mean to be harsh, but we both know it's the truth. If you're so tired of being his butler, you should kick him out."</b></p>

<p>Deming shook his head. <b>"No, I just need to get laid, that's all. I'm just pent-up. I'll go out tomorrow after work and feel better."</b></p>

<p>Sohyun shook her head and sighed. <b>"It's more than that, but whatever let's you sleep at night."</b></p>

<p>Deming tossed some cut chicken and onions into the skillet and stared at them frying for a few minutes before turning to Sohyun, who was brushing her hair at the table. <b>"Noona, what's your schedule next Wednesday?"</b></p>

<p>Sohyun kept brushing her hair as she talked. <b>"Well, my reprieve is over starting on Monday, which, by the way, my day off was great, thanks for asking."</b> Deming mumbled a quiet apology and she continued with a smirk. <b>"I have a modeling shoot all day Monday. Tuesday I have the morning off theoretically, but then I'm back to modeling in the afternoon. And Wednesday, I'm reviewing some recordings."</b></p>

<p><b>"There's a group of production folks - bunch of people from different companies that I know - getting together for drinking. It's an all quietly queer group, and I asked Junha to come with me. As a date. As my boyfriend, specifically."</b></p>

<p>Sohyun paused and put her brush down. <b>"Wow, that's uh, that's -"</b></p>

<p>Deming cut her off. <b>"I know. I know. He's probably going to flake. If he does, or even if he doesn't, will you come with me? If he doesn't flake, I won't  blame you if you don't want to join. I mean, it's a bunch of sound nerds getting together to whine about their bosses and all that. So it probably won't be thrilling. But if he doesn't come, would you-"</b></p>

<p>This time, Sohyun cut him off. <b>"Of course I'll come. Hopefully there will be some girls there?"</b></p>

<p>Deming nodded. <b>"There's a cute girl who does pre-production with Rise, I think you'll like her."</b></p>

<p><b>"Nice, you've sold me. Buy my drinks."</b> Deming laughed and nodded. <b>"He better come. If he doesn't..."</b> She trailed off. <b>"You really ought to..."</b> She trailed off again.</P>

<p><b>"I know, I...I should. But I'd rather not. It's hard to find people who will tolerate me."</b></p>

<p>Sohyun shrugged. It wasn't the first time she had heard this kind of train of thought from Deming. <b>"It's a big world. I think you'll be fine."</b></p>

<p><b>"Would you date a flaming slut though? Fuck, sure, that's fine. Sluts are great to fuck, we have the best sex because we do it a lot. But like...I don't know. I turned thirty-three this year. Some folks that I used to sleep with are essentially married now. I feel like, if I don't settle down a bit at least, I'm going to really fuck myself. I'm going to be a washed up old ho trying to sleep with guys who won't give me the time of day."</b> Deming began aggressively chopping again, garlic this time. <b>"It's just depressing. And pathetic. Especially pathetic. I'm  not going to say I'm going to die alone because I sure <i>hope</i> you'll give me a room when you settle down and get yourself a wife but..."</b> Deming let out a hefty sigh as he dumped his very minced garlic into the skillet. <b>"It seems more and more unlikely."</b></p>

<p>Sohyun got up, strutted over to Deming, and smacked him across the face. It was a light smack, with a bit of sting. For appearances, for the point, more than pain and anger. But it made the point well. <b>"Shut up. Seriously, just shut up."</b> Deming sighed again, and Sohyun crossed her arms. <b>"You're so fucking obnoxious sometimes."</b></p>

<p><b>"Sorry."</b></p>

<p><b>"You could actually try dating guys instead of fucking them.</b></p>

<p><b>"I don't even know how to date."</b></p>

<p><b>"Wine and dine, bitch. You do it with me all the time."</b></p>

<p><b>"Yeah but, I'm not trying to sleep with you. You let me cuddle with  you whether or not I buy you dinner."</b></p>

<p><b>"I don't know, just pretend we're hanging out until you start getting bedroom eyes, then snap into that sexy version of yourself I see you do whenever you go to the bar."</b> Sohyun rubbed Deming's face where she had slapped him, then looked down at the skillet. <b>"Smells good."</b></p>

<p><b>"Thanks. Sit down, I'll serve you soon."</b></p>

<p><b>"See, you're totally husband material. Cooking and everything."</b></p>

<p><b>"Heh. And all I ask for is an occasional fuck and some emotional support. Too high of a price to pay."</b> Deming tossed some rice into the skillet and gave it a few stirs before sitting down and drinking some of his neglected beer.</p>

<p><b>"You need to talk to him."</b></P>

<p>Deming nodded. <b>"Tonight, we'll talk."</b>

<hr>

<p>Deming and Sohyun had their dinner around 8pm, and then Deming sat himself down at his keyboard to work on an exquisitely sad Kate Bush remix - one that he had been working on for quite some time. It was a remix of one of his most beloved songs - "Running Up That Hill", and he tended to work on it when he was feeling especially blue. It had the musicality that could only come from a very depressed older gay. He had remixed it about eight times now, but none of the versions he created were <i>right</i>, and he didn't expect this one to be any different. </p>

<p>Around midnight, Deming heard the door to their apartment open and he took off his headphones. <b>"Ah, you're still awake."</b> Junha said as he closed the door and walked into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Deming got up and followed him. <b>"Dinner was ready at 9pm."</b></p>

<p><b>"Can we please not, tonight -"</b></p>

<p><b>"<i>Sit</i> down,"</b> Deming went to the fridge and got out a bowl of friend rice, and dropped it unceremoniously in front of Junha, before sitting across from him. <b>"Sohyun is not your messenger, you have a phone."</b></p>

<p><b>"Deming, please, I had a long day -"</b></p>

<p><b>"So did I. I had a horrible day at work, came home, and my lovely roommate told me you'd be home at 9pm. So I stayed home and cooked, hoping, I just might catch a glimpse of my imaginary boyfriend."</b></p>

<p>Junha groaned and put his chopsticks down. <b>"Ok, so we're definitely doing this now. At midnight."</b></p>

<p><b>"I just want to understand why it's so hard for you to text me. Why did you tell Sohyun you'd be home by 9, and then it's four hours later when you finally are here. That's what I want to know. If y ou could,  you know, have some basic respect for me as an individual and just text me to tell me you're going to be out late, I could have gone out tonight and we wouldn't be having this conversation now."</b></p>

<p><b>"Look - I'm sorry. I should have -"</b></p>

<p>Deming cut him off. <b>"You said literally the same thing last week, when we had this same fight. Nothing's changed."</b></p>

<p><b>"This week has been horrible, my midterm was savage, and then my study group -"</b></p>

<p><b>"Do you even understand what I'm mad about? Can  you comprehend why I am frustrated?"</b></p>

<P>Junha sighed before replying. <b>"Yes, I understand."</b></p>

<p><b>" </b>

<hr>
Finally, on a sunny Wednesday, Deming bounded out of work, on time for once, with a kick in his step. He hadn't seen Junha the night before, but they had texted and his boyfriend said that they could meet at the apartment and go to the bar where Deming's small collection of sound weirdos had all decided to have a nice, cozy wasted Wednesday in the comfort of other queers. Part of him was still a bit skeptical though - and as he walked up the stairs to the apartment, he felt it coming back in him. That he would walk in the door, and there would be no Junha, and then he'd call him, and he wouldn't answer. And he'd have to go to this event where he said <i>I know it's hard to believe, but I'm actually bringing a partner for once,</i> and it wasn't just another guy that he fucked a lot. He had brought Zihao to a couple of these, being another queer in production, but it was never as a boyfriend. Just a friend that he liked to fuck (and he was fairly certain that between himself and Zihao, they had cumulatively screwed all of the male sound nerds).

<p>But unfortunately, when Deming unlocked to the door to the apartment, he realized his worst assumption was <i>far</i> from the worst. The door to his bedroom was closed, and his cat was curled up on Sohyun's chair looking particularly peeved and greeted him with an annoyed meow. He never closed his bedroom door (he had a good window, it would be rude to do such a thing). And he heard sounds coming from his room. <i>Sounds.</i>

<p>Deming's mind went blank, and he dropped his bag on the floor and flung the door to his bedroom open, where he found his boyfriend getting exquisitely plowed by a very muscular guy. On his bed. Which, in a different mental state, would turn him on quite a bit, but right <i>now</i> when the two of them hadn't had sex in over a whole week, and when they were supposed to go out on a fairly important and significant date (to Deming at least), that they had planned for. 

<p><b>"Ohhhh! Shit, shit! S-stop!"</b>

<p><b>"Oh don't even fucking bother Junha."</b> Deming hastily started taking off his tie, and then his shirt, while he stomped near his closet so he could look at Junha's sweaty face and his blown out eyes as he talked to him. <b>"You mind as well enjoy yourself, one of us ought to."</b>

<p>The big, very muscular and smooth guy, stopped pounding Deming's boyfriend's ass to look between the two of them with a frown. He was looking at Deming, but directed his question to Junha. <b>"I though you said y'all were open."</b>

<p>Deming smiled a wicked angry smile at him as he pulled off his shirt and undershirt. <b>"Oh, we are. Or, were. We were open. He just had plans in, oh, five minutes ago."</b>

<p><b>"Shit,"</b> the attractive top said.

<p><b>"Shit indeed."</b> Deming tossed his clothes in the vaguest direction of his hamper while frowning at Junha. He tried to keep his anger specific at his soon-to-be ex boyfriend. He had no real issues with this very hot top, and if he managed to see him sometime in the future at a gay bar, he would <i>certainly</i> want to tap that. And not just out of vengeance, the guy was objectively <i>hot as hell</i>, big ass, arms that could break a neck. Probably a big dick too, but he couldn't see that part. He put  on a nice tight black tank and pulled off his slacks to exchange them for some equally tight black pants. <b>"Please don't mind me. Feel free to finish up."</b> He zipped up his pants and took a look at himself in the mirror. Not quite right. He shuffled through his closet looking for his leather jacket, and tossed some of Junha's clothes on the ground until he found his most beloved jacket. <b>"Junha, take your time, but I want all your shit out of this apartment by the time I wake up tomorrow."</b>

<p><b>"You-! Seriously?! Where am I going to go?"</b>

<p>Deming shrugged as he pulled on his jacket and scowled at the mirror once again. Damn, that guy had a nice ass, he thought as he admired that ass in the mirror. <b>"You'll figure it out. Not my problem now."</b> Deming turned around and steeled himself for his final angry rant. <b>"Look, I gave you an ultimatum to make up for how much of a goddamn selfish asshole you've been. And  you fucked it - or you decided to get fucked. I get that, but <i>we</i> could have fucked later tonight, or found another equally hot guy to fuck us both at the end of the night. But you were a selfish little prick once again, and I just can't. I can't do it, Junha, I just can't. Move your shit out by tomorrow morning."</b> He grabbed a pair of nice yellow leather Docs to give his outfit a splash of color, and finally stomped out of the bedroom, slamming it behind him. And then he sat down on the couch as he put on his boots, and gave his cat a nice chin rub. She was still real angry, and so was he. He was a lot of things. But he had to go, and he gave her a kiss and slammed his way out of the apartment.

<p>He got on the train, got off a stop before the closest one to the bar, and started walking in the vague direction of the bar. He shot a text to Sohyun: <i>you're still down for tonight right?</i> He couldn't bear himself to be needy. And then he stumbled his way into a corner store and bought himself a strong alcoholic seltzer and a pack of smokes, and lit one up right when he left and cracked open his drink. Sohyun, such a ride-or-die, responded quickly. <i>Sure am, baby. Be there in 15</i> and he breathed a smoky sigh of relief. And then he slowly meandered his way to the bar, stopping a few blocks away in an alleyway to finish off his drink

<p>And that was when he broke. Deming crouched down, letting his long black bangs fall into his face, and he started silently crying. He gave himself the agency to have a few <i>hics</i> as he cried, but then no more. He stood up, pulled his glasses off to wipe his eyes, and lit up another smoke to walk the rest of the way to the bar. His lungs would hate him tomorrow, but he'd also hate himself tomorrow too. And it didn't matter anyways - he had already crafted a nice little story he was going to send to his boss tomorrow morning. His dad was sick, or something, he needed to go home to Busan for a few days for a family emergency. Et cetera. 

<p>When he finally got to the bar, he saw Sohyun looking real classy in a little red dress with a big black jacket over it as she gazed at her phone, but when she heard footsteps approach, she glanced up. <b>"Oh dear. No Junha?"</b>

<p><b>"Junha is moving out tomorrow."</b>

<p><b>"Oh. Oh wow. Are you -"</b>

<p>He cut her off. <b>"No. Not ok at all."</b>

<p>Sohyun pulled him into a hug and then pushed him back a little bit to get a good look at his face. <b>"You look like shit. Hold on,"</b> She dug around in her purse before finally producing a cute hello kitty towel, took off his glasses, and started wiping his face. He felt a <i>hic</i> and a choke building up, but pushed them down, down, as far down as they would go. <b>"You also smell like an ashtray, but I'll save my scolding for later. How bad?"</b>

<p><b>"Worse than you can imagine,"</b> Deming replied, eyes pressed tightly shut.

<p>Sohyun let out a deep sigh. <b>"God, <i>that</i> bad? Hell. But also - good riddance."</b> Deming nodded. Good riddance indeed. <b>"We can, like, go get a hotel for the night and get wasted just us, if you want? I'm down."</b>

<p>Deming shook his head. He was determined to see his weird sound friends - it had been what felt like ages at this point, and he could manage it. Maybe. Get a second, third, fourth drink in and he figured he could do it. Maybe he could even manage to seduce someone - no, probably not. But the company would be good, if nothing else.
