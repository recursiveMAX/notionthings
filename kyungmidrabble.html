 <h1>& more facts</h1>
- grew up fairly poor - her parents worked in a restaurant run by her aunt
<br>- always loved reading and writing from a young age - she was that weird kid that sat in a room of adults, in the corner, happily reading a book
<br>- saw education as her ticket out of the life her family lived, and from a young age committed herself to studying, writing, and being The Best at everything she did
<br>- went to Seoul National University on a full ride with a sizeable stipend for living expenses
<br>- she knows her family hates her, she barely visits and is fairly ashamed of the life they live. it hurts, a bit, but she's an independent woman, and lives her life as if she has no family
<br>- eldest of three siblings, and she hasn't seen any of them in at least ten years
<br>- and for that matter, oh god, please never ask her about her family. that's one sure way to get kyungmi to clam up
<br>- has always wanted to write a lesbian romance book. she started writing one as a grad student but never finished it. when she isn't slammed at work, she writes a chapter here and there
<br>- if you know cho kyungmi, you'd never expect her to write this kind of story - a soft loving story about two best friends that grow up together, and find each other again as middle aged women and fall in love (all over again), it's sappy, she's a sap deep down
<br>- never been in a relationship. she had some girlfriends here and there, but they usually fizzled out after a couple months. she's too busy to keep a relationship going
<br>- also so many women want more than kyungmi can offer. she doesn't have it in her to always be there for friends or lovers - her work taps out her emotional labor resources
<br>- overly polite in public, kyungmi has a nasty potty mouth when she is in her office or home
<br>- she's heard her personal assistant call her the "witch queen" and she likes it. it's fitting. 
<br>- she hated the movie "the devil wears prada" because she felt attacked
<br>- also the book was way better anyways (and she still felt attacked by it)
<br>- polyglot - kyungmi loves learning languages, and has found that if she has even a basic working proficiency in the native language her topics speak, she can dig deeper than she could speaking in english. 
<br>- she essentially learned french for one specific article and kept up with it. 
<br>- she religiously journals every night before bed, and occasionally between meetings at the office. sometimes her journal entries are lengthy exposes on her day, other times it's just "I had a really fucking good taco today"
<br>- but as long as she writes <i>something</i> daily she's happy.
<br>- she tries to cultivate an outward persona of extreme style, elegance, and professionalism
<br>- but deep down, she's kind of a trash can. she eats a lot of top ramen and goes grocery shopping in her pajamas at 11pm
<br>- and wears sunglasses at night when she's in her pjs so, hopefully, nobody realizes who she is
